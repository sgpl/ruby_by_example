Plays a shuffled version of self with the play_file method.
=end

=begin
 In this case, weâ€™re asking the ShufflePlayer to loop 
 through each element of @files, call that element file, 
 and call some method called play_file, taking file 
 as an argument. 
=end

	def play()
		@files.shuffle.each do |file|
			play_file(file)
		end
			# this can also be re-written as: 
			# @files.shuffle.each {|file| play_file(file)}

			# blocks can either start with { and end with } OR 
			# start with "do" and end with "end" 

			# blocks delineated with {} are evaluted before blocks delineated with "do and end"
