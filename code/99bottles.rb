#* destructive methods (end with a bang or exclaimation point.)
# they change the state of their object which means that they perform some action 
# on their object that persists after the method has been called. 

# interpolation: #{} <<using this within double quotes. 

# only the class itself can access the methods that are defined 
# after the word private. 


# 

# The initialize method is automatically private, and 
# the (public) new method of any object automatically 
# calls the (private) initialize method of that same object. 
# Thatâ€™s why we create an initialize method when we write
# completely new classes.
